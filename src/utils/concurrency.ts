/**
 * A Semaphore implementation that controls access to a shared resource by multiple
 * concurrent processes or tasks, allowing a fixed number of permits for resource access.
 *
 * A semaphore is useful when you want to limit the number of concurrent operations
 * that can be performed on a specific resource. If there are no available permits,
 * tasks will be queued until one becomes available.
 *
 * This implementation uses a queue to manage waiting tasks and provides methods to
 * acquire and release permits.
 *
 * @example
 * const semaphore = new Semaphore(2); // Allows 2 concurrent tasks
 *
 * // Task 1
 * async function task1() {
 *   await semaphore.acquire();
 *   // Perform some work
 *   semaphore.release();
 * }
 *
 * // Task 2
 * async function task2() {
 *   await semaphore.acquire();
 *   // Perform some work
 *   semaphore.release();
 * }
 *

 * Each key is associated with its own {@link Semaphore}, allowing granular
 * locking behavior. By default, each key allows only one active operation
 * at a time (exclusive lock), but the number of permits can be configured.
 *
 * @example
 * const lockManager = new LockManager(1); // Exclusive lock per key
 *
 * async function updateUserData(userId, data) {

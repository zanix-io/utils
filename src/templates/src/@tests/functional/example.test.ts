/**
 * Functional Test Template:
 *
 * A functional test evaluates an entire feature or system functionality from the user's perspective.
 * It ensures that the system behaves as expected in real-world scenarios, interacting with various components or external services as necessary.
 *
 * **Purpose**:
 * - Functional tests check whether the overall behavior of a feature or system meets the requirements.
 * - These tests often involve multiple components and ensure that end-to-end functionality works as intended.
 *
 * **Example**:
 * - Testing a function that retrieves data from an API or verifying the behavior of a global module in the system.
 *
 * **Instructions**:
 * - Replace this example with your own functional test and feature logic.
 * - Functional tests typically simulate user interactions or system behavior, so they may involve APIs, UI components, or external systems.
 * - Ensure that the test covers the feature’s real-world use case.
 *
 * **Best Practices**:
 * - Write functional tests that simulate actual user behavior or interactions with the system.
 * - Focus on testing the expected behavior of the feature as a whole, not individual components.
 * - Use descriptive test names that clarify which feature or functionality is being tested.
 *
 * **Example Code**:
 * ```ts
 * // Sample function that returns a success response from an API
 * function fetchData(): Promise<{ success: boolean }> {
 *   return Promise.resolve({ success: true });
 * }
 *
 * // Functional test to verify that 'fetchData' returns success as expected
 * Deno.test('Functional Test Example: fetchData returns success', async () => {
 *   const result = await fetchData();
 *   assert(result.success === true, 'Expected success to be true');
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * **Additional Notes**:
 * - Functional tests often require interactions with external systems like databases or APIs. Mocking may be used when external dependencies are involved.
 * - Focus on testing the feature or flow as a whole, rather than individual components.

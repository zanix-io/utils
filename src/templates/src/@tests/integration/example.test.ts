/**
 * Integration Test Template:
 *
 * An integration test ensures that different parts of the system (functions, components, services) work together as expected.
 * Unlike unit tests, which isolate individual components, integration tests verify that multiple components or units interact correctly.
 *
 * **Purpose**:
 * - Integration tests check how different parts of the system communicate and function together.
 * - These tests ensure that integration points—where different modules or services connect—work as expected.
 *
 * **Example**:
 * - Testing a function that sums item prices to ensure that it correctly aggregates data from multiple parts of the system.
 *
 * **Instructions**:
 * - Replace this example with your own integration test logic.
 * - Focus on testing the interaction between multiple parts of the system.
 * - Integration tests may involve functions that interact with databases, APIs, or other services.
 *
 * **Best Practices**:
 * - Ensure that the test covers scenarios where multiple components or services are interacting.
 * - Keep the test focused on the interaction between the parts being tested, not on the internal details of each part.
 * - Use descriptive test names that explain the integration behavior being verified.
 *
 * **Example Code**:
 * ```ts
 * // Sample function to calculate total price from a list of items
 * function getTotal(items: { price: number }[]): number {
 *   return items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0);
 * }
 *
 * // Integration test to verify that 'getTotal' sums item prices correctly
 * Deno.test('Integration Test Example: getTotal sums item prices correctly', () => {
 *   const items = [{ price: 5 }, { price: 10 }];
 *   assert(getTotal(items) === 15, 'Expected total to be 15');
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * **Additional Notes**:
 * - Integration tests may interact with real data or services (e.g., external APIs, databases).
 * - You can use mocking or stubbing for external services if needed to isolate the integration being tested.

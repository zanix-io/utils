/**
 * Template for Types Declaration File (`.d.ts`).
 *
 * This file serves as a template for defining custom types, interfaces, and other type declarations
 * used throughout the project. It helps TypeScript understand the shape and structure of various
 * objects, functions, or modules in the codebase.
 *
 * **Usage**:
 * - This file is intended to be used as a declaration for external modules or custom types that
 *   need to be available globally across the project.
 * - Modify or extend this template to include your project's specific types, such as interfaces
 *   for API responses, configuration objects, and more.
 *
 * **Guidelines**:
 * 1. Use `interface` to define the shape of objects.
 * 2. Use `type` to define more flexible or complex types (e.g., union types, intersection types).
 * 3. Export types if they are to be used in other parts of the codebase.
 * 4. Always ensure that types are well-documented for easier understanding and maintenance.
 * 5. Add type annotations to any functions, variables, or parameters that need to be explicitly typed.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```ts
 * interface User {
 *   id: number;
 *   name: string;
 *   email: string;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * This template can be customized for different needs and should be updated as new types or modules
 * are introduced in the project.
